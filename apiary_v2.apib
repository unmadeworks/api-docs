# Unmade Integration Reference V2

Welcome to the Unmade OS Integration Reference.

See [Integrating With Unmade](#/group-integrating-with-unmade) to get started.

This is **Version 2** of this documentation, which describes the usage of the `v2` API Endpoints. For **Version 1**, [click here](https://engineering.unmade.com/api-docs/#/).

# Group Integrating with Unmade

Unmade integration into your e-commerce site relies on 4 key steps:
1. **Product setup**
Customisable products within your e-commerce site need to store a reference that can link them to the corresponding Unmade Editor.

2. **Editor integration**
The Unmade Editor is embedded to the product detail page of customisable products using an `<iframe>`.

3. **Save DesignID**
When users have finished customising, your e-commerce site needs to store a unique Design ID throughout your native checkout process.

4. **Order creation**
Once the purchase has happened through your existing systems, the Design ID needs to be used to trigger the order creation within Unmade.

Further to these core steps, we provide additional APIs that allow you to build more advanced customer journeys and integration:
- **Order API** In addition to order generation, you can retrieve order data using this API to get production state and tracking number.
- **Design API** You can get rendered images of a customer's design using this API and the Design ID the Editor has provided.
- **Factory API** Your factories can use our Web interface to download manufacturing data, or this API.
- **Roster API** You can create a new design using variable data using a roster base design.

# Group API setup

## Partner-specific sub-domains
Each integration with Unmade will run on partner-specific resources. This means the URLs shown throughout this documentation are just examples and you should get your specific URL from your Unmade customer contacts.

``` https://{your-partner-subdomain}.embed.unmade.com/ ```

**Reminder** : The URL of each endpoint must end with `/` otherwise unexpected 401 errors might happen.


## Authorization
The Unmade APIs use Token Authentication. Your unique token will be provided to you by Unmade and needs to be used in the header of your API requests like so:

`Authorization: Token ABC123123`

## Error responses
Error responses from our API endpoints adhere to RESTful standards. The numeric HTTP status code reported by the web
server can be used to determine the reason for the error (e.g. 404, meaning resource not found).

These error responses always include a `code` and a human readable `message`. This could be used for your logging purposes, if they need to be read by humans.
We do not recommend writing any logic that depends on the exact text of the message e.g. using a regex or string matching.
These messages are more likely to be subject to change, whereas response status and code are less likely to change.

Where possible, we also include a `detail` field. This field contains specific details of the error that was encountered.
This data is designed to aid with debugging and facilitate integration with Unmade APIs.

## Advanced setup

If you have opted for user-uploaded asset support in your Unmade Editor then there is one additional step for integration.

In order for a user to upload an asset in the Unmade Editor your e-commerce site has to provide us with a unique identifier for that user so that we can store the logos that a user has uploaded and show them to the user when they return to the Unmade Editor.

We will cover two workflows; an Unmade Editor is initialised with an authenticated user of your e-commerce site, and an Unmade Editor requests a user to be authenticated.

## Secure provision of an authenticated user identifier

We make use of [JWT](https://jwt.io) with the HS512 algorithm, to ensure secure communication between your e-commerce site and the Unmade Editor.

Unmade will generate a shared key and provide this key to you. This shared key must be stored securely on both sides. Your e-commerce site will need to use this shared key when generating a token to be passed to the Unmade Editor iframe on initialisation.

The payload that your e-commerce site will need to generate will contain an unique identifier for that authenticated user. This unique identifier must not be an email address or any other personally identifiable information. We suggest you create a new field that is a UUID (Universally Unique Identifier).

The payload with the unique identifier will be encrypted by your e-commerce site using the shared key and a JWT library to generate a JWT token and will allow Unmade to decrypt it, using the shared key.


## Initialising an Unmade Editor with unique identifier for an authenticated user

1. For your authenticated user, your e-commerce site MUST generate a payload that contains a "user" property which has the unique identifier for the authenticated user as it's value:

    ```
    {
      "user": "3fad6a89-8cec-4350",
    }
    ```

    Using the appropriate JWT library, your e-commerce site should encrypt this payload with the shared key. This should generate a token, that looks a bit like;

    ```
    eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJ1c2VyIjoxNTE2MjM5MDIyfQ.66pC0Ncp6ZiUGljv5dlF8uKO1jQQ04Fvkj7z56VfBjg
    ```

2. Append this token to your Unmade Editor URL, for example:

    ```
    https://{your-partner-subdomain}.embed.unmade.com/v2/products/{your-product}/?init=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJ1c2VyIjoxNTE2MjM5MDIyfQ.66pC0Ncp6ZiUGljv5dlF8uKO1jQQ04Fvkj7z56VfBjg
    ```

3. The Unmade will decode this token and

    If the token IS valid the Unmade Editor UI will enable the ability to upload the relevant asset.

    If the token is NOT valid the error will be logged and the Unmade Editor UI will disable the functionality of uploading content.

    We have the following types of validation/error messages:
    - wrong key
    - unable to decipher
    - missing info in the payload
    - missing "user" property on the payload


## Initialising an Unmade Editor without a unique identifier for an authenticated user

If you initialise the Unmade Editor without an authenticated user then the user will still be able to customise the product and can be prompted to authenticate with your e-commerce site if and when they try to upload an asset.

1. For an unauthenticated user, the Unmade Editor should be initialised without a JWT payload.

    ```
    https://{your-partner-subdomain}.embed.unmade.com/v2/products/{your-product}/
    ```

2. If and when the unauthenticated user clicks to upload an asset, the Unmade Editor iFrame will first save the design.
We then inform your e-commerce site that the user needs to be authenticated in order to continue via a JavaScript postMessage
to the parent window. See [the postMessages section](https://engineering.unmade.com/api-docs/#/group-js-post-messaging-interactions)
of this document for more details on the structure of this message.


3. Upon receipt of this postMessage, your site should authenticate the user using your site's login mechanism.
Then re-initialise the Unmade Editor with a unique identifier for the authenticated user and the saved Design ID:

    ```
    https://{your-partner-subdomain}.embed.unmade.com/v2/products/{your-product}/?init=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJ1c2VyIjoxNTE2MjM5MDIyfQ.66pC0Ncp6ZiUGljv5dlF8uKO1jQQ04Fvkj7z56VfBjg&design_id=7fad56a8def33980cc3f90
    ```

4. The Unmade Editor will then enable the authenticated user to upload assets and continue editing their design.


## Restrictions for user uploaded assets

The Unmade platform will perform some checks on the files that are uploaded. All uploaded files must:

- Be an SVG
- Have a maximum filesize of 1MB (Configurable by request)
- Consist **only** of the following element types:
  - `svg`
  - `g`
  - `defs`
  - `symbol`
  - `use`
  - `circle`
  - `ellipse`
  - `line`
  - `path`
  - `polygon`
  - `polyline`
  - `rect`
  - `metadata`
  - `desc`
  - `title`
  - `linearGradient`
  - `radialGradient`
  - `stop`
  - `solidcolor`
  - `color-profile`
  - `marker`
  - `mask`
  - `clipPath`
- Not contain elements with any of the following attributes:
  - `opacity`
- Not contain elements with references to external images
- Have a maximum of 6 unique colours *

If the uploaded file violates any of these restrictions, an error message will be displayed in the UI and the file will not be saved.

Each user is prevented from uploading more than 400 individual assets by default. This limit is also configurable on request.

\* *A "colour" is defined as any value of any of these attributes: `stroke`, `fill`, `stop-color`*


# Group Unmade Editor
The Unmade Editor is the web interface that lets users customise a product and visualises the customisation choices in real-time using Unmade's photo-realistic visualisation technology.
Each customisable product we have jointly developed has its own specific Iframe URL - even if the underlying customisation editor (the options available and the user interface) are the same.

The Editor is embedded into your website as an `<iframe>` element and you can send specific attributes to affect localisation, the price displayed or load a previously created design as a starting point.
There are multiple different ways in which you can choose to integrate the Unmade Editor into the customer experience you are building - this means that the integration of the actual `<iframe>` can be different on a case-by-case basis and we are happy to assist and advise on this.

An example of how you may want to embed the iframe is below:
```
<iframe
  src="<URL>"           // Iframe endpoint URL
  frameborder="0"       // Set to no border
  width="100%"          // Width set to 100%
  height="100%"         // Height set to 100%
  scrolling="no">       // Scrolling turned off
</iframe>
```

## Unmade Editor integration [/v2/products/{slug}/{?price,ccy,locale,design_id,init}]

+ Parameters
    + slug - The product slug (will be agreed with you)
    + price (optional, number) - The price to display for the product
    + price__<product_slug> (optional, number) - If using the UnmadeOS Collections feature, prices can be specified for many individual products in this way
    + ccy (optional) - The ISO 4217 currency code corresponding to the `price`
    + locale (optional) - The IETF language tag to set localisation of the user interface
        + Default: `en-GB`
    + design_id (optional) - An Unmade Design ID that is compatible with this editor to be used as starting point
    + init (optional) - An JWT payload encrypted with your shared key which includes a unique identifier for your customer. See [advanced setup](https://engineering.unmade.com/api-docs/#/group-api-setup#header-advanced-setup) for more information.
    + mode (optional) - Specifying `mode=admin` will enable additional UI controls, including the ability to lock elements of the design.

## Iframe endpoint [GET]

The response to this request is a well-formed HTML document used as content for the `<iframe>`.

Use this URL as the `src` attribute value on an `<iframe>` element to embed an Unmade-powered product in an
external e-commerce website.  Note that there are optional query parameters.

Depending on your specific editor UI design and the rest of the content on the page you are embedding the Unmade Iframe on, you might need to take different approaches to managing the size of the `<iframe>` element on the page. We are happy to advise and support on this.

            }


# Group JS post messaging interactions

## JS post messaging in general

Certain actions performed by the customer in the iframe will result in events being sent to the host website using the
[postMessage](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/postMessage) API. A JavaScript listener, such as the following, should be implemented on the host site:

```
window.addEventListener("message", receiveMessage, false);

function receiveMessage (event) {
  var origin = event.origin || event.originalEvent.origin;
  if (origin === "https://{your-partner-subdomain}.embed.unmade.com/") {
    switch (event.data.type) {
        case 'UNMADE_design_saved':
            addToCart(event.data.payload);
        case 'UNMADE_interaction':
            resizeIFrame(event.data.payload);
        default:
            break;
    }
  }
}
```

## Saved design
```type: "UNMADE_design_saved"``` **required**

Once a customer has finished creating their design in the Unmade Editor and click "save" or "add to bag" within the Iframe, Unmade will save the user's design, generate a `DesignID` and pass this ID to you by Post Messaging to the parent window.

This action will also take place if the user triggers an action that would take them away from the Unmade Editor, for example attempting to upload content whilst not logged in.  In this case, the host website should respond to the postMessage by storing the `DesignID` and prompting the user to log in, at which point the `DesignID` can be associated with the user's account.

In addition to the `DesignID`, this postMessage also includes the URL to a preview image you can immediately access (for example, to show the custom design during the checkout process) and other details about the user's design.

This postMessage also includes a `meta` key, containing additional information about the event that triggered the save and whether the user was logged in or not.

Please note that the payload of this message is identical in structure as the response of the [Design API](#reference/design-api) described further below.

Example postMessage:
```
{
  type: "UNMADE_design_saved",
  meta: {
    triggeredBy: "upload"    // see table below for possible values and their meanings
    userLoggedIn: false      // or true
  },
  payload: {
    id: "0c9e9b2b-ee60-439a-9172-819df97d7987",     // Design ID
  }
}
```
### The triggeredBy attribute in design saved postMessages

The triggeredBy attribute contains information about why the design was saved, as this is not always the user completing a design.

    + `save`
        + **Triggered:** When the user clicks 'add to bag' inside the Editor iframe, Unmade will save the user's design and pass the generated design ID to the parent window in a postMessage.
        + **Next step:** Add to bag. Add the product to the user's cart.
    + `upload`
        + **Triggered:** When a user token is not provided and the user clicks upload, we save the design and postMessage the design ID so you can log them in.
        + **Next step:** Show the user a login modal, redirect them to this design ID on successful login.
    + `share`
        + **Triggered:** When the user clicks 'share' inside the Editor iframe, the process is the same as when the user clicks the 'add to bag' button.
        + **Next step:** Generate a URL that directs users to the design ID and show the user a share dialog.

### User interaction
```type: "UNMADE_interaction"``` *optional*

We can optionally configure to send the Parent Window a message to trigger interactions event outside the Unmade Iframe.
For example, if within the Unmade Iframe there is a link to a Size Guide that should trigger a modal handled by the parent window.

Example postMessage:
```
{
    payload: {
        clicked: 'sizing',
        type: "UNMADE_interaction"
    }
}
```

### The clicked attribute in interaction postMessages

    + `variable_text_help`
        + **Triggered:** When the user clicks the help button in the roster embellishment section of the editor
        + **Next step:** Open a modal or link with help information
    + `logo_upload_help`
        + **Triggered:** When the user clicks the help link when uploading a logo
        + **Next step:** Open a modal or link with help information
    + `legalCopy`
        + **Triggered:** When the user clicks the terms and conditions link
        + **Next step:** Open a modal or link with terms and conditions information
    + `sizing`
        + **Triggered:** When the user clicks the size guide link
        + **Next step:** Open a modal or link with size guide information
    + `save_design`
        + **Triggered:** When the user clicks the save design button
        + **Next step:** Open a loading overlay


Please note that to direct the user to help content about logo uploading, we also support an HTML hyperlink instead of the postMessage functionality.

## Group Design API
### Retrieve designs [/v2/designs/{design_id}/]

Once a user has created a design using and Unmade Editor and you have saved the Design ID, you can use the Design API to request images and information on that saved design.
This lets you:
- download multiple high resolution renders of the design to show in your customer journey, use in retargeting or a "my account" section of your website
- identify the URL of the Unmade Editor used to create this design, so that you can construct a URL to load the Editor with this Design ID as a starting point
- get structured data about some of the customisation choices made, this currently covers selected size, gender, components, placements and colours and patterns used on design elements (printed areas)
- fetch the applied logo for a placement that the user has uploaded, per placement the `user_logo_upload` key will contain information about the asset including `asset_url` where the asset can be retrieved
- identify if on any of the placements has been applied a non vector logo within the `user_logo_upload` key there will be a `is_vector` key that if the value is `false` will indicate the asset is not SVG
- identify the source design id for grouping purposes, the source design id will be the design created originally on the editor and not via any other APIs
- identify the roster placeholders that have been applied to placements with enough information to create the roster members.
- identify the colours used through the design and where are they used.

# Group Transfer Preview API

The Transfer Previews allows you to generate preview images which show how a given Design would appear when applied to 
a different Product. These images could be used for cross-selling or marketing purposes by your site. For more info on 
this functionality, see the [live demo](https://engineering.unmade.com/design-transfer-demo/).

## Create Transfer Previews [/v2/transfer_previews/]

Passing a valid Product Slug and Design ID to this endpoint creates one Transfer Preview for each scene available for 
the target product's default size.

You can then use the provided image URLs to load the images in your site. These previews function in the same way to 
normal `/v2/previews/` URLs and are generated on demand when first requested. The URLs are suitable for direct use in an
`<img>` element, or could be saved to your backend for future use.

# Group Roster API

## Retrieve Roster design data

If a given product has roster functionality enabled, an editor user will be provided with the option to select a roster 
field for any enabled region. A design saved with one or more of these roster fields is known as a "roster design".

A roster design can be identified by the presence of the `roster` key in its API representation. See [here](https://engineering.unmade.com/api-docs/#/group-design-api)
for full details of this representation.

An example `roster` object is shown below:

```json
{
  "roster_fields": ["player-name"],
  "data": {
    "player-name": {
      "id": "player-name",
      "display_name": "Player Name",
      "placeholder_text": "Your Name Here",
      "allowed_characters": "ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz0123456789",
      "placements": [
        "Center Chest",
        "Upper Back"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

This indicates that a single roster field: `player-name` was selected for this roster design.

The `display_name` of the field is a human-readable representation of the field for use when creating player designs.

The `placeholder_text` field is the temporary value that the roster region is populated with when saved. In this 
example, the editor user would see the string "Your Name Here" in the region for which they'd selected this field.

The `allowed_characters` is the full set of characters which can be used to populate this field when creating player 
designs.

`placements` are the human-readable names of the physical placements on the garment to which this field will be applied. 
In the above example, the value provided for the `player-name` field would be placed in both the "Center Chest" and 
"Upper Back" placements. This data may be useful for the generation of forms for collecting these values from your 
members.

## Create Member Designs [/v2/designs/base_design_id/roster/]

Once the "template" roster design has been created, the `/roster/` endpoint can be used to populate the roster fields 
with the real data for your members.

To create member designs, the `/roster/` endpoint accepts POST requests with payloads containing the roster design ID, 
as well as the values of each field to be populated. Upon receipt of a valid payload, a new design is created, and its 
ID is returned. This ID can then be used to place orders as required.

Successfully created member design IDs can also be queried via the [Retrieve Design](https://engineering.unmade.com/api-docs/#/group-design-api/resource-v2-designs-design_id-10bff8d2)
endpoint as normal. The `placements` data for member designs will include the `origin_roster_field_key` for any 
placements which originated from roster fields.

Many member designs can be created from a single roster design.

To create a member design, the `/roster/` endpoint must receive valid values for **all** roster fields specified for a
given roster design. You can send empty values (e.g. `""` or `null`), for example to generate a design without a name or
number.

The provided values for each roster field will be validated to ensure they contain only allowed characters and that, 
once rendered in the chosen font, they are not too wide for their respective placement. If there are validation errors 
we return a 400 response detailing the codes for the validation errors for each field. Possible validation error
codes are `illegal_character`, `text_too_wide`, `text_sanitised`, `text_truncated`, `text_too_long`.

Additionally, for each error type a `details` object is provided. This contains the filtered / truncated text that 
*would* be permitted in the placement.

## Create a member design [POST]
#### Roster field rules

To create a member design, a single `roster_member` object containing the required values for all roster fields in the 
template roster design is provided:

# Group Ecommerce Orders API

The Ecommerce Orders API is accessed via your `https://partner-subdomain.embed.unmade.com/` URL. All requests require 
your authorization token which is passed as an HTTP request header.

## Order States

As an order progresses through its lifecycle it will adopt one of a number of order states. These states are as:
follows:

    + `new`: This order has been received by Unmade, but is not in production yet
    + `submitting`: This order is being sent to the factory for production
    + `submitted`: This order has been sent to the factory for production
    + `in_production`: The manufacturing of the order has started at the factory
    + `ready_to_ship`: This order is waiting to be picked up at the factory
    + `shipped`: The factory has marked this order as shipped
    + `cancelled`: This order has been cancelled
    + `hold`: This order is on hold and has not yet been submitted for manufacturing
    + `failed`: This order has failed. (Error state, please contact Unmade)

## Create Orders [/v2/orders/]
## Create an Order [POST]

Once an order has been placed on the ecommerce platform, the Unmade system should be notified to begin the process of
generating manufacturing files. To do this, pass a unique order reference, and one or more order items to this endpoint
via an HTTP POST request. Each item must reference an Unmade Design ID. The same Design ID can be used for multiple
order items, if provided with different `size` values inside the `options` object. To order multiple identical garments
in the same size, use the `quantity` value. Each item must also have a `unit_price` object with both a `value` and
`currency` specified. Depending on the nature of your integration with Unmade, a `shipping_address` may also be required
for order creation.

Optionally, arbitrary key-value pairs can be passed as a `partner_data` object at both the order and order item level. 
This may be used by your system to provide your internal ID or similar reference for this order which may be relevant
for integration with your vendor. These key-value pairs will also be present on the manufacturing order and jobs 
associated with this ecommerce order.

If you want to create the order and keep it on hold for subsequent updates to the `partner_data` you might do it by
sending the boolean value for `set_order_on_hold` as `true`.

You may optionally provide a boolean value for the `is_test_order` field to indicate a given order is not a real
production order. If this value is set to `true`, the order will be omitted from Unmade billing processes. Speak to your
Unmade representative for more information about recommended integration testing procedures.

## List Order Items [/v2/orders/{order_id}/items{?page}]
## List Order Items [GET]

This endpoint can be used to retrieve a paginated list of the individual items in a given order. We preserve the order
in which the items were sent in the original order creation payload. The `id` of each item is generated automatically
by Unmade when the order is created. You may choose to store this ID in your systems in order to reference each item
directly in future.

Each order item has three associated Design IDs which have different relationships depending on how the relevant 
designs were created, as well as the type of order. In the simplest case these Design IDs may be identical, but will 
usually be different, depending on a variety of factors.

 - `input_design_id`: The Design ID which you originally sent in the Order creation payload to create this item
 - `manufacturing_design_id`: The ID of the design which is being used as the source of all manufacturing data for this 
    item. This will be different to the `input_design_id` if you specified a different size to that of the order 
    item design: in this case Unmade will generate a new design in the specified size
 - `source_design_id`: The ID of the Design which was originally saved by the user in the editor. If the Roster API has 
    been used to create the member design for this item, this ID will be the ID of the original roster **template** 
    design.

These Design IDs can be used in the Design API to view personalisation data or fetch previews relevant to this order 
item. In most cases you'll want to use the `design_id` value for this purpose.

# Group Factory API

After an Ecommerce order has been created, Unmade begins a process of converting the various line items in the order 
into production jobs which can then be manufactured at your vendor factory. The Factory API is used to interact with
all order data related to this production process.

Each Ecommerce Order maps to exactly one Factory API Order. The same order ID can be used in the order endpoints on both
APIs.

The Factory API is accessed via `https://factory.unmade.com/`. All requests require your authorization token which is 
passed as an HTTP request header.

## Order States

During production, orders progress through the following states:

 - `new`: The order has not yet begun production
 - `in_production`: The order has been accepted and is now in production
 - `ready_to_ship`: The order has been produced and is awaiting shipping
 - `shipped`: The order has left the factory
 - `cancelled`: The order has been cancelled

## Set Ex-factory Date [/factory.unmade.com/v2/orders/{order_id}/set_ex_factory_date/]
## Set Order Ex-factory Date[POST]

On creation, Unmade assigns all production jobs an Ex-factory date based on a lead time estimate which has been 
pre-agreed with you and your vendor. This serves as a target date by which the piece is expected to have left the 
factory location. Jobs within an order can have different Ex-factory dates depending on per-product lead times. In the 
case of unforeseen delays (or unexpectedly quicker production!) this endpoint can be used to pass an updated Ex-factory 
date to Unmade. If provided, all jobs in the given order are assigned this updated Ex-factory date. This update also 
propagates up to this order's associated Ecommerce order to allow the Ecommerce system to notify to the end-consumer.

## Retrieve Job [/factory.unmade.com/v2/orders/{order_id}/job/{job_id}]
## Retrieve Job[GET]

This endpoint can be used to retrieve data for a specific job in a given order. In addition to basic metadata, this 
endpoint provides:
  - Structured data describing the various customisation options chosen by the user for this job (eg. selected 
   **components**, **text** and **colours**)
  - URLs to one or more `previews` for this job
  - The URL for a zip file containing all manufacturing files for this job
  - The URL to this job's ticket PDF


### Note on Manufacturing Files

When an order is first submitted to Unmade, it takes a short time for manufacturing files to be generated. As such, for
very new jobs, the `manufacturing_files_zip` field may be `null` if no files are ready yet. Sometimes the zip file may
be present, but only contain an incomplete set of the manufacturing files for the given job.

Unmade currently recommends not fetching the `manufacturing_files_zip` file until 1 hour has elapsed since the order's 
`submitted` time. After this time, the zip file will contain the full set of files for each job in a given order.

+ Parameters
    + order_id (string) - ID of the Order in the form of a uuid
