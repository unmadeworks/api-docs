# API docs
Documentation of our *public* API to be used by our partners

# Where the doc is published?
This is repo at the moment it's linked to the documentation [here](https://unmade.docs.apiary.io/).

# How can I make changes to this documentation?
There are two ways that you can make changes. They are sync'ed and so
both will update both our documentation on Apiary and also the `master`
branch on github.

## 1. Make changes through the [Apiary editor](https://app.apiary.io/unmade/editor)

This provides a live preview making it easy to see the result of the
changes you are making.

## 2. Make by issuing and then merging a pull request

This does not provide a live preview BUT makes it easier for you to
share your changes with others and get comments and feedback from the
wider Unmade team ahead of making the actual changes to our
documentation.
